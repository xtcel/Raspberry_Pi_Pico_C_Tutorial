Raspberry Pi Pico comes with a Dual-Core ARM Cortex M0+ processor, which can run up to 133MHz. It has 264KB of SRAM and 2MB of onboard flash storage, but we can extend up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via a dedicated Quad-SPI bus. We get a total 26 of multi-functional GPIOs that support 3.3v digital I/O with 3 of them also being analog inputs. Raspberry Pi Pico also supports highly flexible power supply architecture, like micro-USB, external supplies or batteries. The most important thing is that we don't need any programmer to program a Raspberry Pi Pico because it works on “Drag-and-Drop” programming using mass storage over USB.
